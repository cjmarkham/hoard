# Storage Engine for Event based Data

Hoard is currently a prototype for logging event based data. It's currently in early alpha testing, and not suitable for production.

## Install

### Console:

    php console.php install


# Running Locally

The easiest way is to run the built-in web server that comes with PHP 5.4

    php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public router.php

You can also run via any standard web browser such as Nginx or Apache. Simply use "public" as the webroot.
